# InvestSense

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.0.

The aim of this project is to act as an observability and analytics tool to show you the growth of your investment portfolio. For personal use case, I am building this with the Kotak Securities API, but may introduce other broker APIs in future.

**Disclaimer** - I am new to Angular and am still learning. Please be responsible about your own secrets and credentials. Don't put them in the repository or in your fork. Reach out to me if you see any vulnerabilities.

## Extra Tools Used

Firebase for authentication

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
